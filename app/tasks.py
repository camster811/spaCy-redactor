# Import asyncio and maintain an in-memory dict of job_id â†’ status/results

# Define a coroutine to perform redaction
# - Accept job_id and input text
# - Call redact.py logic
# - Store result and mark job complete

# Define an async-safe job queue mechanism
# - e.g., asyncio.Queue (optional in early stage)
